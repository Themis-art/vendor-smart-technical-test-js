<h1 align="center"> 🟩 Vendor Smart Technical Challenge 🟩 </h1>

<h2> 📝 Project description </h2>
*This project was inspired by the technical challenge proposed by Vendor during the internship selection process. I thoroughly enjoyed working on it and took the opportunity to learn new things. Despite being less familiar with the JavaScript programming language and using a test framework I had never used before (Jest), I decided to take the risk and dive into the project. < br / > 
*This project utilizes the readline module, which is a core module in Node.js. As a prerequisite, the evaluator of the challenge will need to have Node.js installed on their machine to execute the code correctly. Additionally, I’ve incorporated the Jest framework for writing and running unit tests.]

<h2> 🛠️ Installation </h2>
*Make sure you have Node.js installed. If not, you can download it from the official website: Node.js.

<h2> 📋 Testing ✅ </h2>
*To run the unit tests, execute the following command:
`npm test`
or
`npx jest`
